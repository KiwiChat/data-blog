  Thanks for this excellent post -- hard to find good information on this topic
  that is explained so clearly! Regarding the pROC multiclass.roc function, it
  seems it still has not been modified...nonetheless, what is the disadvantage
  to using what it provides -- that is,  the mean AUC from all pairwise class
  comparisons -- vs using the Hand & Till formulation? Thank you much!
