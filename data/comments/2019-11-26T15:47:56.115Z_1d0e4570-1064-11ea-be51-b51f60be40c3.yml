message: "This is an excellent article!  There are very few posts out there comparing specificity vs precision approaches from a \"Why\" perspective and in such a well thought out way.  Thank you!\r\n\r\nThere is a mistake under \"What can go wrong when using precision\"\r\nYou say\r\n\"Precision is a particularly bad measure when there are few observations that belong to the **positive** class. Let us assume a clinical data set in which 90% of persons are diseased (positive class) and only 10% are healthy (negative class)\"\r\n\r\n(You're firstly saying that precision is a bad measure when the positive class is a minority.  You then go on to give an example where 90% of population are in positive class.)"
