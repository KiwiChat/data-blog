message: "Dear Hugo,\r\nYou're right - Fisher's exact test also works with tables with dimensionality greater than 2x2. What I meant with my statement is that the application of Fisher's exact test to larger tables is not as straightforward as the chi-squared test. When the dimensionality exceeds 2x2, Fisher's exact test quickly becomes computationally infeasible. Then, the p-value cannot be calculated exactly anymore but one has to resort to Monte Carlo simulation (`simulate.p.value=TRUE` when calling `fisher.test`). Of course, this shouldn't stop you from using the test if you expect that a non-parametric test is more appropriate."
