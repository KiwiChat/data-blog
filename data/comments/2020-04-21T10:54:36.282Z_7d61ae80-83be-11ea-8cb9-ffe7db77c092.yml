  Thank god, I've been on the web from sometime looking for this obscure tidbit
  of knowledge. Can I restate to make sure that I've got it? A small Cramer's V
  value coupled with a significant effect could be and is most likely the result
  of a population size that is too big? That the significance is only on account
  of a huge n value. If so how do you operationalize a "too big". That's to say:
  What are the values of Cramer's V, n, with a significant effect, that would
  still be valid in a study. It's been 2 years so I hardly expect a reply, but
  you never know.
