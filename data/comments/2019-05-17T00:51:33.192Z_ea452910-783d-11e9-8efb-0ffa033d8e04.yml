  Breaking Benjamin is my favourite rock-band of 2000s. They had so many hit
  songs! The ones I remember are 'The Diary of Jane', 'Tourniquet' and their hit
  'So Cold'. These are real masterpieces, not fake ones like today! And it is
  awesome that they have a tour in 2019-2020! And I'm going to visit their
  concert in 2020. The tour dates is here: <a

  page and maybe we can even visit one of the performances together!
