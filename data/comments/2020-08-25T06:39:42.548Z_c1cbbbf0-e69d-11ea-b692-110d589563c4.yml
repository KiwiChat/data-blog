message: "Heyy!! Your blog is amazing. A very helpful article for prospective students. This is such a detailed article about informatics. I really learnt valuable insights about Bioinformatics. A sincere thanks for this article.  \r\nI just finished my high school from India and am really interested in this field of study. I opted for undergraduate study in Computer Science Engineering in an Indian College and am planning to do my Masters from an abroad college which can provide me quality education in Bioinformatics. \r\nWhich country has more opportunities in this field? I would also like to apply for scholarship program abroad. What type of research works should I do during my college years so that I will have a profile different from others? I think I should try learning some subjects related to Biology so that I can understand research more. \r\nI am kind of confused in which path I should start working on first. It would be great if you could give me your valuable advice in this matter."
