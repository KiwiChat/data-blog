message: "Dear Tsholofelo,\r\nYou seem like a self-motivated person who is keen on acquiring new skills. This, I think, is already a very good requirement to start venturing into bioinformatics. Hower, to score an internship and develop further in bioinformatics, I think that it is necessary to have either a proven track record in the field or another qualification in the data science or computer science realm. So, if you want to make a move towards bioinformatics, your best option is probably to acquire a degree (BSc) and then go on with that. Another possible option would be to take online courses and then look for an opportunity in your current job (e.g. for when evaluating research studies), where you can apply these skills.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n Matthias"
