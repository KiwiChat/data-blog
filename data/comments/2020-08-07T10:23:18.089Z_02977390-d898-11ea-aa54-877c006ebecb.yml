message: "I am a Neonatal Intensive Care Registered Nurse. I find myself very stimulated by clinical research studies, i love anatomy and physiology. In my current line of work i find myself constantly searching...watching videos on cells, proteins, ions and channels as it all intrigue me, its interesting to study a disease process. \r\nAt some point i got connected on a free online Harvard course \"Principles, Statistic and Computational tool for Reproducible Data Science. It was super interesting, but i couldn't get to the end due the complexity of the computational tool aspect of the course, it was advanced...more inclusive to someone with a strong not basic IT background.\r\n\r\nNonetheless i remain keen, I actually grew more interest than ever in bioinformatics. How i yearn for an opportunity to study this field as an intern preferably due to single parenting...gotta keep my salary.\r\n\r\nKindly guide"
