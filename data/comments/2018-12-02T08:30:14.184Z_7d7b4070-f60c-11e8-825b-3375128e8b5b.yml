  Is this expression data? You can find some useful [processing steps and
  packages at
  Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/arrays/inst/doc/arrays.html).
  You probably want to perform some form of clustering on the expression data in
  order to identify whether there are groups of persons with similar patterns of
  over/underexpression. What are you exactly planning to do?
