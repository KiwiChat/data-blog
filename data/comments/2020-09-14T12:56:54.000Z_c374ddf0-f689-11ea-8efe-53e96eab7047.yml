  Thanks for this look into feature engineering (link here with
  https://www.explorium.ai/feature-engineering/). People are so focused on the
  insights machine learning can generate, they forget the work that creates
  them. Improving this process, the feature generation process as one example,
  is essential to producing the most accurate insights.
