message: "#8 suggests that `production` comes from `origin/dev`.  I checked [your API instance](https://staticmanbot.herokuapp.com).  Since the message \"version 3.0.0\" comes out, *it should be v3* unless you touched the NodeJS code---I did play with that to understand how Nicolas Tsim's PR worked.  In fact, *without* his help, I wouldn't had managed to get Staticman working on localhost.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `invalidVersion` error, please ensure that you've set up the form action according to Staticman v3's URL scheme described, again, in eduardoboucas/staticman#219---an additional Git service provider is needed in the request URL: either `github` or `gitlab` for the moment.  Without this, a `400/500` error will be thrown.  You may view my sample GitHub/GitLab sites for a *minimal* working examples.  Each of them contains a *working* URL in their form `action`.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, free Heroku dynos should *never* be used for production services.  I regret not having stated this clearly in my guide.  I'm using a free Heroku dyno to *test* Nicolas Tsim's PR219, hoping that this would get merged against `origin/master` from `origin/dev`.  However, it seems that you're using Staticman for your professional blog, so you may expect your free dyno to idle from time to time.\r\n\r\nAnyways, that's already a great leap since now we own our comments.  This allows better $\\rm \\LaTeX$ support, which is *not* available on Facebook, WordPress, Disqus, etc.  Changing this to KaTeX and GitLab is even *better*.\r\n\r\nIn terms of CMS integration, Netlify has a [great support](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/13/gitlab-integration-for-netlify/) for that.  A simple search should return relevant *official* news from *both* corporations.  Nonetheless, it's *better* to avoid proprietary technologies so as to avoid being tied with them.  Staticman is a tool for gaining control over your comments, while GitLab CE is a tool for gaining control over version control.\r\n\r\nGood luck for your Staticman !"
