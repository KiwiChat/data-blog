  Good analysis. A bioinformatician myself in Germany, I would like to add that
  i got the impression that the candidates who succeed getting a weil-paid job i
  pharma are the ones with a PhD and hundreds of high- impact research papers.
  In other words: to get a well paid job in the industry, it is a very difficult
  and long path ! All the others without a PhD end up as system administrators
  in a hospital, pretty low paid. If you are into math and computer science, i
  would rather recommend studying the original: Computer science / informatics
  and not bioinformatics. Your job perspectives are much broader then.
