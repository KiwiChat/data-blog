message: "Thanks for your comments Erbo. You're right about the ordering in the table - the positive class should definitely come first, I just changed this. Regarding the ordering of predicted/reference I'm not sure, I think I have seen both versions, so I will keep it as is. I hope it's not too confusing ;-) I agree, however, that it would make things much easier if there was really a standard for the format of confusion matrices.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, the rate rates were indeed off for the second example. It should be fixed now :-) Thanks for having a keen eye!"
