message: "It's a very informative article sir. \r\nI'm currently pursuing my master's degree in microbiology. I also enjoy studying genetic & molecular topics. Currently, I'm doing an internship in bioinformatics. And my interest is growing towards this so I want to pursue my carrier in bioinformatics. So as a microbiologist can I apply for a bioinformatics job with my internship experience or should I get a master's degree in bioinformatics?"
