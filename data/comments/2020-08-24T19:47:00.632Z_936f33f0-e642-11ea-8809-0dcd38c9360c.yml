message: "Hey,quite an informative post.\r\n\r\nI have completed by bachelors in Biotechnolgoy and am planning to go for a MS or PhD course in Computational Biology. Since I do not have a good background of coding, I was wondering if it is absolutely necessary to excel in coding and software development to do well in the Graduate degree and get into a good industry. \r\nAre there any industries that would prefer data analysis over software development etc. or would it be difficult if I am not good at coding to survive in this field?"
