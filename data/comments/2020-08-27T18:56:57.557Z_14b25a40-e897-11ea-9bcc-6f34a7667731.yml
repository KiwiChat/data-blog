message: "@Anika:\r\nWith regard to coding, there are fewer requirements than in industry because it's usually more about theoretical contributions (i.e. new methods) than practical contributions (working code). In general, you should be able to do some coding because even if you are focusing on data analysis this requires coding in the context of the analysis (data extraction, data wrangling, use of appropriate libraries for statistics/visualization,...). Actually, I have the feeling that most bioinformatic jobs are more about the analysis than the engineering, so you don't need to be a software engineer to work in bioinformatics. But you need to know the methods and be able to use them in terms of libraries.\r\n\r\n@Namrutha:\r\nYeah, I'd you are starting with the masters you probably have to catch up on the biology. Which area to focus on is a tough one. Starting out I would suggest general molecular bio and genetics. Some organic chemistry may also be useful.\r\n\r\nGenerally, hot topics in bioinformatics follow the hot topics in biology. So just take a look at the new technologies there and you will find new areas for Bioinformatics. I feel that the majority of people are working on sequencing technology, particularly next-gen and, more and more, Single-Cell sequencing.\r\n\r\nSince I did my PhD in Germany, I can tell you that there is a very active research community here. For industry jobs, the US is probably better though."
