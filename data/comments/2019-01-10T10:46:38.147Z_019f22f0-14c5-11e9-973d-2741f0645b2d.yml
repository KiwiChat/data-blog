message: "You can use subfolders. Just access them in the template with \"index .Site.Data.comments $subfolder\"\r\n(.Site.Data.comments is just a map, and the \"index\" function allows you to access arbitrary map elements by key)\r\n\r\nI haven't tried this yet but to fix the sleeping dyno problem, I'm thinking of adding a bit of javascript to ping my server when the user starts typing a comment. Hopefully by the time they're done the server will be awake."
