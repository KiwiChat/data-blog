message: "Sir,  your article is very informative.  I am a graduate in computer science and post graduate in computational biology with very little experience in machine learning as in I have worked with supervised learning both on biological and non biological dataset. I am interested to pursue research but I also want more experience working with biological data sets.  What would be your suggestion to this, whether to apply for PhD or to apply for job positions in pharma industry?  If to apply for job positions, what kind of positions should be applied for with the above mentioned experience?  \r\nLooking forward to your response..."
