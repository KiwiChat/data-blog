message: "Hi Matthias, \r\nI am a post graduate Biotechnologist from India and i found this very informative. On my path to career, i am thriving my Phd from a US university in the field of Bioinformatics for which i am preparing for my graduate tests currently. My approach towards maths and \r\nphysics is same as you described in your previous years...can you give me any suggestions on that? Like which fields or job roles i can work in if am stronger in life science areas and what kind of project (in what topic) taken could be helpful to achieve for my Phd? Or should i take the field or not? To add, i have got 2 international publications on QSAR and Docking respectively and a recently i have done an online course on basic MATLAB from HarvardX which includes basic Coding... and through all this i found so much interest in this field. Though, few people suggested me to not to choose the field, as it could be really different in 2 distinct countries.\r\nIf someone as experienced as you can give some suggestions to a student like me it would be very helpful of you. Thank you."
