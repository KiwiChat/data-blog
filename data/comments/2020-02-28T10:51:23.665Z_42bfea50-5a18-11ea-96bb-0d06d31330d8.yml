message: "Dear Matthias,\r\n\r\nThank you for this post. Why do you say that \"chi-square test is more suitable for contingency tables greater than 2x2\"? As far as I know, the Fisher's exact test also works with such tables. Is there any statistical reason for choosing chi-square in these cases?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n      Hugo."
