  The interpretation of inference seems to be a bit narrow. For engineering
  tasks, we use inference to determine the system state. For example, we want to
  know if a machine is faulty or if there is a disease present in the human
  body. Therefore, we use the methods, which, in the article, were referred to
  as being used for prediction, for inference.
