message: "Thank you so much for such an informative post. \r\nI have completed my Bachelors in Bioinformatics and I'm planing to join Masters in Molecular and Computational Biology in Germany. I'm interested to work in an Industry post my Graduation. I have less knowledge in programming and trying online courses to learn python. Could you please suggest me some areas that I need to work on to get a Job as a Bioinformatician. Also in Germany how can I find related jobs and internships to enhance my skills?"
