message: "Your tutorial deserves a static comment.\r\n\r\nAs the author of the linked guide, I would like to point out that (self-hosted) *GitLab* is supported as well in the [new development version](https://dev.staticman.net) of [Staticman](https://staticman.net).  In fact, that's **the** goal for writing my *series* of tutorials a month ago: to summarize my efforts for deploying eduardoboucas/staticman#219.  To allow *common netizens* to understand the work of Nicolas Tsim, who actually developped Staticman's GitLab support, I've built [a minimal Hugo GitLab Pages](https://vincenttam.gitlab.io/test-hugo-staticman).  Staticman's public development server *can't* be used for that purpose because Eduardo Bou√ßas has *never* disclosed its associated GitLab account.  Idealistically, this PR would be merged into the master branch after others have successfully ran his code.\r\n\r\nCoincidently, Staticman's public production API server is reaching its limit, and I've (re-)proposed hosting a custom API instance as an *ad-hoc* solution.  *The true motive is to test Staticman v3's functioning with GitHub.*  As your test results suggest, your instance is running v3, so I suggest you to change the `form action` URL from `v2` to `v3`.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the technical setup, here's some points that I would like to add:\r\n\r\n1. Creation of a *root-level* `Procfile`with `web: npm start` is the *key* to get the whole thing *works*.\r\n2. I would rather say *exclude* `config.production.json` from `.gitignore` for clarity.\r\n\r\nRegarding the last section, it *is* possible to store Staticman's generated YML files in different (sub)folders.  The `path` and property name can be set in `staticman.yml`, whereas the subpath is controlled by the slug name.  You may view my aforementioned sample Hugo site for details."
