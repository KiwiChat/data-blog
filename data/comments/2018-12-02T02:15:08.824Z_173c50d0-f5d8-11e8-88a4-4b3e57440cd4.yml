  Confusion matrix layouts are confusing. ;) Maybe It's a European thing? I'm
  used to the top row being TP, FP and columns being "predicted." Anyways in the
  last section, I'm getting different sensitivity, specificity, etc values for
  the second algorithm. I think the counts are off in the confusion matrix.
  Relevant and Irrelevant totals don't match the first algorithm totals.
