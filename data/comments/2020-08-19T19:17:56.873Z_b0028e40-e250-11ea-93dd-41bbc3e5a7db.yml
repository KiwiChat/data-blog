message: "Dear Vini,\r\nFrom what I understand, your question is about the job prospects of microbiology vs bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nFrom what I heard it seems that microbiology is very competitive, which is why many people strive for PhDs. With bioinformatics, I think, there are generally more career options: you can go into software engineering, data science, or, of course, bioinformatics."
