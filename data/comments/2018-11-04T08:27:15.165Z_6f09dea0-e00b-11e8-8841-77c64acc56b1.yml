message: "Dear Vincent,\r\nthanks for the comprehensive, *static* response. The direct support of GitLab pages with the new development version of Staticman sounds neat. I didn't cover this possibility in this post though because I'm currently using Netlify rather than GitLab for deployment.\r\n\r\nRegarding the API version: I also thought that the Staticman API was at version 3.0. But I guess that the main branch, which I cloned, is still at version 2.0. because when I try to do a POST request with v3 I get ```invalidVersion``` via the ```errorCode``` field. \r\n\r\nRegarding Staticman and folders: It's true that it is possible to store the files in different folders, I also did that. The problem I had, however, was accessing these comments using Hugo because [file access there seems to require specific paths but not dynamic paths](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/). For example, you can access the comment files using ```.Site.Data.comments``` but you wouldn't be able to access files if you construct a filename using something like ```print .Site.Data.comments <pathToDirectory>```. \r\n\r\nThanks for the additions as well. I'll update the post and mention the Procfile!"
