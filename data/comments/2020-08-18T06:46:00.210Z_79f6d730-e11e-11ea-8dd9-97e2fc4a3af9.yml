message: "Dear JK,\r\nDepends on your future plans. If you're fine with \"conventional\" (i.e. non-research jobs), then you could just start applying with your MSc. If you already know that you want to go into research, be it industrial or academic, then the PhD will be a natural next step.\r\n\r\nWith a CS degree and no bioinfo specialization you may have a hard time getting into a bioinformatics job, so a PhD in bioinformatics may be a good idea to complement your skills if you know that you want to do bioinformatics."
