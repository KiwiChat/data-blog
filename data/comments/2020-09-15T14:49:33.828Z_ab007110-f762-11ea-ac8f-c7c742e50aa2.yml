message: "Great! This was an informative article. I just have completed my BS in agriculture. And i want to do my Ms degree in bioinformatics. So is it possible to go from agriculture to bioinformatics?  And i start to learn python. For bioinformatics should i need to be an excellent coder like an CSE student ? Or it is enough to just learn normal python language? And just doing a Ms degree can i be able to get any bioinformatics related job?\r\nThanks."
