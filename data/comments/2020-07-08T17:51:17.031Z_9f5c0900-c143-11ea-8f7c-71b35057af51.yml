  It's interesting that you assert that only large pharma utilizes
  bioinformatics scientists. When I was interviewing for jobs after grad school,
  I had interviews with biotech companies, medical device companies, clinical
  laboratory companies, healthcare analytics, contract research organizations,
  and agricultural seed production groups.
