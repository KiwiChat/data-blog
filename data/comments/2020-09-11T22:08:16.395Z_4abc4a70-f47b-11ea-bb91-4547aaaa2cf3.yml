  Thank you so much for all this information! I am in need of your advice too. I
  studied veterinary medicine in a non-EU country and I'm about to finish my PhD
  this winter. I would like to switch to IT and do more computer-based things. I
  would also really like to study in Germany, I have required language
  knowledge, but it would be impossible for me to finance my studies without
  stipend. So I thought that Master in bioinformatics could be just a solution
  for me. Can you give me some advice about my chances in applying and what can
  I do to improve them? Right now I don't really have any programming skills,
  but I plan to start online courses. Vielen Dank im Voraus!
