message: "I'm a professor of bioinformatics in London. Nice post, but a couple of points:\r\n\r\nFirst, how mathematical bioinformatics is depends very much on the area that you are studying- bioinformatics is extremely broad. The MSc course on which I teach has a module on stats, but otherwise very little maths. Conversely one of the other London university courses has lots of maths because it focuses more on systems biology.\r\n\r\nSecond, at least in academia, I disagree with your suggestion that few bioinformaticians come from a biological background; in my experience most of the successful researchers have a non-computing background, because you need to understand the biology to ask the right questions. The computing is a tool to address those problems."
