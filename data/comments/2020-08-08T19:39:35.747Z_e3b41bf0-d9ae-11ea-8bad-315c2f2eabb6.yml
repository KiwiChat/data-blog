message: "Dear Nasima,\r\nThat's a very good question. I think with your background and the internship you could have a chance for bioinformatics position. However, the position would probably have to fit really well to your microbiology background because other candidates (i.e. those with Bioinformatics degrees) would likely outcompete you for the role. So, if you find something that sound's fitting, just give it a try and apply. If that doesn't work out for you, I would first try to get a track record in bioinformatics (e.g. through online course/projects) that you can demonstrate on a online platform such as GitHub. With your background, personnel managers would likely be most concerned about your skills in programming and the theoretical Bioinfo knowledge (e.g. which methods to apply for each problem).\r\n\r\nIn any case, since you are stil studying, it may be worthwhile to switch to the Bioinformatics MSc. if this is the field where you want to work in. You may even be able to take some cred points from microbiology with you."
