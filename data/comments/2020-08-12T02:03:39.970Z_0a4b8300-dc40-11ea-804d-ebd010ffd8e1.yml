  I got my PhD in bioinformatics, graduated in 2016. Within our program, about
  50% stay in academia as professors, post-docs, or staff, and the other go into
  industry. I myself am a data scientist for a healthcare consulting company.
  Before spouting statistics about where graduates go, please do some more
  research and cite how those numbers were calculated.
