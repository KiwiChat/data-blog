message: "Dear Brandt,\r\nThanks for your valuable comment. You are right, there are definitely more options for bioinformaticians than pharma companies only. However, when it comes to these other options, there are really two factors at play:\r\n\r\n1. The country in which you are applying for jobs.\r\n2. The specific tasks you'd like to perform in your job.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first point:\r\nMy experience comes from analyzing the job market in Germany. I assume you are probably referring to the US. From what I heard and experienced the US is much more geared towards innovation than Germany, so it is only natural that there are more options available in high risk/high reward sectors such as the biotech industry. In Germany, many companies lack that venturing spirit, so companies often do not jump onto cutting-edge technologies but rather wait and see how the market develops.\r\n\r\nSo, when specializing in bioinformatics you should definitely consider the structure of the economy to identify your opportunities there or whether it would be necessary to move somewhere else to find what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second point:\r\nThe company you choose will be very influential in what you are working on. I think there are two clusters here:\r\n1. Jobs where the focus is on data processing, analysis, and IT administration: e.g. in many hospitals and diagnostic labs\r\n2. Jobs where the focus is on innovation (modeling, machine learning, optimization, ...): e.g. in the pharmaceutical/crop/biotech sector"
