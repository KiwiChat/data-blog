title: Going beyond significance: confidence intervals
content: 
- How is confidence interval defined?
    o Example for CI with 95% and other value
- Why is it useful?
    o Measures the likely size of an effect
    o More useful than p-value (doesn't give effect size)
    o More interpretable than effect size (concrete value)
- Where/how to obtain CIs?
    o Which tests provide CIs?

-> use multcomp package
-> quesiton: use glm rather than ANOVA?

Power analysis
--------------
- title: Study design using power analysis

- Why bother with power?
    o Need to know beforehand how many samples are necessary to have chance of showing effect
- What is power analysis? How does it work?
- How can I do it in R, for several tests?
    o e.g. t.test (see previous post on type 1 vs type 2 error)
