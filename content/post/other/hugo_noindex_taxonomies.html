<p>Taxonomies in Hugo are a great way to structure information provided by a blog. For search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, however, the existence of duplicate content on a site can be a problem. If you think this is the case for your site, then you can use the <em>noindex</em> meta tag for all of the taxonomy sites that do not provide unique content. This post shows you how to get it done.

<div id="adjust-your-themes-baseof.html-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Adjust your theme’s <em>baseof.html</em> file</h2>
<p>The file <em>baseof.html</em> defines the basic structure of your website. You can find it under <em>layouts/_default</em> of your theme’s folder. For example, my <em>baseof.html</em> is located under <em>themes/Mainroad/layouts/_default/baseof.htm</em>. Simply add this code within the head tag:</p>
<pre><code>{{ if .Data.Singular }}
    &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;
{{ end }}</code></pre>
<p>This should instruct all indexers not to index the taxonomy pages. To make sure that it worked you can contrast the HTML meta tags that are generated for regular posts and taxonomy pages.</p>

<div id="why-does-it-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Why does it work?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://gohugo.io/variables/taxonomy/#example-usage-of-site-taxonomies">taxonomy variable documentation</a>, there are some special variables that are only available for taxomy pages. I’ve just picked one of the taxonomy variables (i.e. <em>.Data.Singular</em>) but I could also have used any of the other taxonomy variables (e.g. <em>.Data.Terms</em>). By requiring the existence of these variables, the <em>noindex</em> tag is only set for the taxonomy pages.</p>

<div id="keeping-noindex-and-the-sitemap-concordant" class="section level2">
<h2>Keeping <em>noindex</em> and the sitemap concordant</h2>
<p>If you are setting a site to <em>noindex</em> it also makes sense to remove it from the sitemap. To do this, you can customize the <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/sitemap-template/">default Hugo template</a> template by including the same if-condition as for the <em>noindex</em> tag.</p>

<div id="is-noindex-really-the-way-to-go" class="section level2">
<h2>Is <em>noindex</em> really the way to go?</h2>
<p>While <em>noindex</em> is <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/noindex-category-other-listing-pages/255811/">viable in some situations</a>, I’m currently not using <em>noindex</em> for the taxonmy pages on this blog because they are <a href="https://yoast.com/ask-yoast-noindexing-tags-categories-foodblog/">attracting a lot of search traffic</a>. You should think about the taxonomy pages as landing pages to your blog. So, it makes sense to improve upon the most important taxonomy pages rather than blocking them.</p>
