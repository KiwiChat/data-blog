When I started working in the IT sector, I was impressed by the diveristy of the roles that exist and it took me quite some time to
understand the responsibilities of the individual roles. That is why I thought it would be nice to share my understanding of the most
common roles you will encounter in IT projects. You should definitely read this post if you are thinking about applying
for position in the information technology sector but are unsure which one is the right fit for you or if you're already working in IT and want to improve 
your understanding of other roles.

For each role, I begin with typical statements from persons fulfilling the role, then give a short summary of the role, and finally summarize characteristics of people that excel in the role.

Since most softare development projects are nowadays based on agile practices, I will start with the classical Scrum roles and then go into other positions.

## Roles in Scrum

In this section, I introduce the three roles in Scrum: the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team members.

### Product Owner

The product owner (PO) is responsible for maximizing the value that is delivered by the team. His tasks include:

* **Developing a product vision**: As a PO, it is crucial to have a clear vision about the product in order to maximize the value for the customer.
* **Backlog grooming:** ensure that all backlog items are [well-written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) and [appropriately prioritized](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-prioritize-your-backlog-using-weighted-shortest-job-first).
* **Communiation with the development team:** Often, the PO has the best understanding of new backlog items. He must ensure that he shares his understanding with the development team, e.g. during refinements.
* **Verification of acceptance criteria:** Once a backlog item has been completed by the team, it's the PO's responsibility to verify whether all acceptance criteria have been met.
* **Stakeholder management:** communicate with customers, management, and developers.

The main Scrum meeting that lies in the PO's domain is the sprint planning and the sprint review.

Typical statements of POs may include the following:

```
- Our customers need this feature as soon as possible
- Instead of feature X, we will work on feature Y in the next sprint because ...
- Feature X is important because it ties into epic Y, which delivers enormous value to our clients
- Is this backlog item still unclear? Let me explain again ...
- Unfortunately, we couldn't deliver feature X as quickly as we hoped due to ...
```

In my opinion, a great PO is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Passion for the product:** the PO must make it his mission to develiver the best product possible.
- **Excellent communication skills:** the PO has to communicate with various stakeholders and it is key that he can effectively share his understanding
- **Basic technical understanding:** Although the role of PO is not a technical role, it is beneficial for the PO to have a basic technical understanding. This allows for better communication with the development team and ensures that technical tasks aiming at software quality are not put on the backburner.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum master (SM) guide the team according to the principles set forth in the [scrum guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide). The SM is an enabler who ensures that things run smoothly. Typical activities of an SM include:

* Communicate with the development team and the PO
* Assist the team in removing impediments
* Empower the team members to implement Scrum effectively

The main Scrum meeting that lies in the SM's domain is the sprint retrospective.

Typical statements of Scrum masters include:

* Marc, I think that Jacob has already worked on something similar before. I think you guys should talk to each other!
* Everbody draw a picture of how the last sprint made you feel!
* The database service from the support team is still not up but I'm in contact with them and will let you know when there are news.
* Let's try to keep today's daily at 15 minutes.

What makes a great Scrum master?

* **People skills**: the Scrum master must be a very good communicator and must show empathy towards the individual team members.
* **Creativity**: creativity is a must for removing impediments and developing innovative concepts for sprint retrospectives.
* **Passion for Scrum**: the Scrum master must be a knowledgeable Scrum devotee that electrifies the team with his passion.

### Development Team

The main responsibility of the development team is the technical implementation of backlog items. Typical activities include:

* Technical design and implementation of new software features
* Implementation of automated tests
* DevOps: e.g. implementation of CI/CD pipelines
* Refinement of backlog items
* Development of software according to the Scrum principles

The development contributes to the daily Scrum meetings, refinements, the sprint plannings, the sprint reviews, and the sprint retrospectives.

Typical statements of a development team member include:

* For authentication, we could create a new database table and then store the encrypted credentials of our users.
* Sorry, but I can't estimate this backlog item yet. I just don't understand what the acceptance criteria mean.
* I was really frustrated during the last sprint because it is so painful to implement to implement new features with the current state of the component. We should completely re-write the component as soon as possible.
* Today I want to show you the new user interface we developed during the last two sprints. What do you think?

What makes a great development team member?

* **Technical skills**: A member of the development team should produce high-quality implementations that stand the test of time.
* **Communication skills**: The best technical skills can be useless if a developer is not able to work together with the other members of the team.
* **Technical vision**: While the product owner is responsible for the vision of the product, the development team must have a clear plan about the technical implementation that allows for the realization of that vision.
