I have previously used a data set describing the characteristics of whiskeys to [draw radar plots](/post/data-visualization/radar-plot/). Here, I present how I cleaned and augmented [the original data from the University of Strathclyde](http://outreach.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/nessie/datasets/whiskies.txt), resulting in an [improved version of the whiskey data set](https://www.datascienceblog.net/data-sets/whiskies.csv).

## Loading the whiskey data set

The original data set can be loaded from the web in the following way:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(RCurl)
# load data as character
f <- getURL('https://www.datascienceblog.net/data-sets/whiskies.txt')
# read table from text connection
df <- read.csv(textConnection(f), header=T)
```

## Fixing the post codes

Since there are tab characters and spaces in the post codes, we will clean those up:

```{r}
head(df)
df$Postcode <- gsub(" *\t*", "", df$Postcode)
```

## Annotating the locations of the distilleries

A blog post by Koki Ando gives a nice [overview of how UTM data can be handled](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/375481_d2605e8726364d30a5b20c6974710cf5.html). In the following code snippet, we use the ```raster``` and ```sp``` packages to create a ```SpatialPoints``` object from latitude/longitude coordinates in UTM format. Then, we add UK as a reference point system by specifying *+init=epsg:27700"* ([see epsg.io for other reference coordinates](https://epsg.io)). Finally, we call ```spTransform``` with WGS84 (*+init=epsg:4326*) in order to set the [world geodetic system, which is used for GPS](https://epsg.io/4326).

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
# transform UTM coordinates to longitude/latitude in degrees
geo.df <- df[, c("Latitude", "Longitude")]
colnames(geo.df) <- c("lat", "long") # switch for plotting
library(raster)
# create 'SpatialPoints' object
coordinates(geo.df) <-  ~lat + long
# add coordinate reference system (CRS) for UK
proj4string(geo.df) <- CRS("+init=epsg:27700")
# transform to new coordinate system
# NB: getting rgdal working on old systems is tough due to libgdal dependency
library(rgdal)
geo.df <- spTransform(geo.df, CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))
map.df <- data.frame("Distillery" = df[, "Distillery"], geo.df)
df <- cbind(df, map.df[, c("lat", "long")])
```

## Other annotations

To annotate the regions in which the distilleries are situated, I manually assigned regions by relying on a [list of Scottisch distilleries available at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whisky_distilleries_in_Scotland). I also fixed some spelling errors in the distillery names.

## The improved whiskey data set

The improved whiskey data set is [available here](https://www.datascienceblog.net/data-sets/whiskies.csv).
