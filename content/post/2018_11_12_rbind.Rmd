In the last years, there has been a surge in the demand for data scientists. In fact, the [demand for data scientists has increased by 650% from 2012 to 2017](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/11/linkedins-fastest-growing-jobs-today-are-in-data-science-machine-learning/#417212a651bd). Why is data science such a hot topic? I would argue that this is because multiple factors have come together:

* **Emerging technologies** are producing decidedly more data than previously and these data need to dealt with
* **Recent advances in machine learning** have produced new algorithms that are particularly suitable for big data
* **Digitization is advancing** and data analytics are an important aspect of this trend

## What is a data scientist?

It seems that the [term data scientist was first coined in 2001 by William S. Cleveland](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/915c/d8e2b39eb02723553913d592b2237d4d9960.pdf). In his paper, he argues for the extension of statistics into other areas such as multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, and computing. In my opinion, data science is best understood as an interdisciplinary field gathering all skills that could be useful for processing and analyzing data. [The most relevant data science skills are the following](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-scientists-4a4a8db896db):

* **Modeling:** data analysis, machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and visualization
* **Computation:** computer science, software development, and data engineering
* **Soft skills:** interest in the data and the data generation process, ability to think outside the box, and good communication

Since data scientists need to have such a diverse set of skills, people that excel in all of these areas are called *unicorns* to foreshadow their rarity.

## What is my relation to data science?

To be honest, I am not *officially* a data scientist. I have a Master's in bioinformatics where I am currently pursuing a PhD, so I **never took part in a data science curriculum**. However, I would consider myself to be a bioinformatician as well as a data scientist because the work I am currently doing is very focused on data: It mainly involves machine learning and statistical analyses. 

So, **data science is a fitting umbrella term** since I could apply the same techniques to data from other fields than biology. The same goes for many other people that consider themselves data scientists who originate from a variety of (mostly quantitative) disciplines such as computer science, physics, and mathematics. 

## My experience as a blogger

The last time I blogged is actually a long time back. In 2009 a friend and I created bloxxo, a German blog that offered tips and tricks on how to be a succcessful blogger. Back then, we were very motivated and had **ambitious goals**. Although we were quite successful, quickly forming a close-knit community and obtaining a page rank of 4 after some time, we **could not hold up the pace**. Writing at least 2 posts every day just required too much effort. Besides, both of us were doing our Bachelor studies full-time, so free time was a luxury. Thus, the blog was discontinued.

Now I am returning to blogging again for two reasons. The first one is time. Since I plan to wrap up my PhD soon, I should have more spare time for blogging. The second is my desire to give something back to the community. When I was researching questions related to my work, this was usually gruesome because it took me hours to find working solutions because there are few resources providing well-written, well-structured, and accurate content. 

## My experience with R and blogdown

I had my first experience using R in 2011 and I have been a fan ever since. In the meantime, I have even developed two R packages, which are available via Bioconductor ([openPrimeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/openPrimeR) and [openPrimeRui](https://bioconductor.org/packages/openPrimeRui)). Thus, when I thought about creating a blog about data science, it was clear to me that I had to use R as a programming language.

![Data science blog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25709555/48361301-8462f100-e6a1-11e8-89a7-790378295435.jpg)
The idea behind [my blog on data science](https://www.datascienceblog.net) was to focus on applications of data science using R in areas such as statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. It was particuarly important to me to make all of the blog posts reproducible. This meant that I had to include R code corresponding to each post. After some research on how this could be achieved, I stumbled upon the [excellent blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). At first I was skeptical because I could not believe that it would be that easy to create a website using the package but [it turned out that it was indeed that easy](https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/other/blogdown_hugo/).

## Blog customization

After spending several hours investigating different [Hugo](https://www.datascienceblog.net/tags/hugo/) templates, I decided to use the [Mainroad theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad/) because it is highly content-driven and is therefore ideally suited for a blog. As we all know, the Achilles' heel of static pages is that these sites lack potential for interaction. To enable users of my blog to write comments, I therefore activated the support for Disqus. However, I was never really happy with that decision for two reasons:

1. In my opinion, the Disqus system does not make a very professional impression.
2. Using Disqus, comments are stored on an external server and are not part of the site itself, although they should be.

So, I searched for alternatives to Disqus and stumbled upon [Staticman, which brings user-generated content to static websites](https://staticman.net/). So, I [set up my own instance of Staticman](https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/other/staticman_comments/), which I am currently successfully using to run the commenting system of my blog. This is the way the system currently looks like:

![commenting_system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25709555/48361909-c6406700-e6a2-11e8-94f1-0c8101fd0091.jpg)

Since I am presenting a lot of R code, it was important to me that the code is easily retrievable. Therefore, I implemented buttons for the following two purposes:

* Downloading the raw RMarkdown files from GitHub. This allows readers of my blog to read posts even when they are offline.
* Copying all code from a post. Again, this allows people to easily run the code and experiment with it.
