<p>It is always useful to spend some time exploring a new data set before processing it further and analyzing it. One of the most convenient ways to get a feel for the data is plotting a histogram. The histogram is a tool for visualizing the frequency of measurements in terms of a bar plot. Here we’ll take a closer look at how the histogram can be used in R.

<h2>Plotting a histogram in native R</h2>
<p>The basic histogram fun is <code>hist</code>. It is very easy to use because you only need to provide a numeric vector. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># fix seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)
# draw n samples from the uniform distribution in the range [0,1]
n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- runif(n)
hist(x)</code></pre>

<p>If you need a higher resolution, you can increase the number of bins using the <code>breaks</code> argument:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(x, breaks = 20)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/data-visualization/histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These results indicate that although the samples were drawn from the uniform distribution, there are still some values that are over- and underrepresented.</p>

<h2>Plotting a histogram using ggplot</h2>
<p>If you want to have more control over your plots, then you should use the ggplot2 library, which is part of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse suite</a>. Since the plotting function expects a data frame, we’ll have to construct one first:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
df &lt;- data.frame(x = x)
# map data frame values in column x to x-axis and plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/data-visualization/histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<div id="plotting-a-histogram-for-several-groups" class="section level3">
<h3>Plotting a histogram for several groups</h3>
<p>To exemplify why ggplot is great, let’s assume we have more than one vector we’d like to plot. This can be done in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># normally distributed data
y &lt;- rnorm(n)
df &lt;- data.frame(Category = c(rep(&quot;Uniform&quot;, n), rep(&quot;Normal&quot;, n)), 
                x = c(x, y))
# fill bars according to &#39;Category&#39;
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, fill = Category)) + geom_histogram()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/data-visualization/histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As an alternative to plotting the data within a single plot, one can also use a faceted plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(vars(Category))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/data-visualization/histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One problem with the facet problem is that the scales may be different for the two axes. For example, the data from the normal distribution have a smaller maximum frequency than those from the uniform distribution. Thus, values from the normal distribution are not clearly visible. Moreover, the uniform data are in a smaller value range than the normal data. To fix this problem, we can provide an additional argument that makes both the x-axis and the y-axis flexible:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram() + 
        facet_wrap(vars(Category), scales = &quot;free&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/data-visualization/histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now, the difference between the two distributions is much more easily visible than before.</p>
