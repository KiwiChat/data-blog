<p>Dimensionality reduction has two primary use cases: data exploration and machine learning. It is useful for data exploration because dimensionality reduction to few dimensions (e.g. 2 or 3 dimensions) allows for visualizing the samples. Such a visualization can then be used to obtain insights from the data (e.g. detect clusters and identify outliers). For machine learning, dimensionality reduction is useful for reducing the feature space, which can lead to models that generalize better.</p>
<p>In this post, we will investigate three dimensionality reduction techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principal components analysis (PCA): the most popular dimensionality reduction method</li>
<li>Kernel PCA (KPCA): a variant of PCA that allows for nonlinearity</li>
<li>t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding(t-SNE): a recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between these approaches is that PCA outputs a rotation matrix, which can be applied on any other matrix in order to transform the data. Neighborhood-based techniques such as t-SNE, on the other hand, do not enable the transformation of new data.</p>

<h2>Assumptions about the results</h2>
<p>Before we begin reducing the dimensionality of the data, we should think about what kind of results we would like to obtain. For the whiskey data, we would expect that whiskeys with similar taste profiles are close to each other in the reduced space.</p>
<p>Since whiskeys from distilleries that are in proximity to another use similar distilling techniques and resources, their whiskeys are also often similar. Thus, a reasonable dimensionality reduction should cluster whiskeys from similar regions.</p>
<p>To validate this assumption, we are going to test whether the mean expression of whiskey characteristics differ between distilleries from different regions. For this, we will run a MANOVA test:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m &lt;- manova(as.matrix(df[, features]) ~ Region, df)

<p>The test statistic is significant at the 5% level, so we can reject the null hypothesis (there is no effect of region on the characteristics).</p>

<h2>Geographical locations of the distilleries</h2>
<p>Since regionality seems to be an important element, we will explore where the distilleries in the data set are located by ploting their latitude and longitude. The following Scotch whiskey regions exist:</p>

<p>Having transformed the <code>Latitude</code> and <code>Longitude</code> features <a href="/post/other/whiskey-data-annotation/">from UTM coordinates to degrees</a>, we can localize the distilleries:</p>

<div id="pca" class="section level2">
<h2>PCA</h2>
<p>PCA computes a rotation matrix <span class="math inline">\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}\)</span> from the matrix of features <span class="math inline">\(X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times p}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> can be understood as a mapping function that transforms the observations in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to a rotated space. The coordinates of observations in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are transformed to their new form, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, via</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z = XW\,.\]</span></p>
<p>The rotation matrix <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is constructed through orthogonal linear transformations. Each of these transformations is performed such that it maximizes the variance in the unexplained variance in the data, resulting in individual <em>principal components</em>, which provide a new coordinate system.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why PCA is so popular is that it is a very interpretable method. Each principal component (PC) is well-defined as we know that it is a dimension orthogonal to the other dimensions. Since PCA maximizes the variance with each PC, we can obtain the variance that is explained by each PC in order to select an appropriate number of dimensions.</p>
<div id="results-of-pca" class="section level3">
<h3>Results of PCA</h3>
<p>Using PCA, I would assign three clusters to the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(cluster)
library(ggfortify)
data &lt;- df[,features]
rownames(data) &lt;- paste0(df$Distillery, &quot; (&quot;, df$Region, &quot;)&quot;)
cl &lt;- pam(data, 3)
# learn about the interpretation of the principal componenets:
autoplot(cl, frame = TRUE, frame.type = &#39;norm&#39;, loadings.label = TRUE,
         loadings.colour = &quot;black&quot;, loadings.label.colour = &quot;black&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="1536" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>autoplot(cl, frame = TRUE, frame.type = &#39;norm&#39;, label.repel = TRUE,
         label = TRUE, label.colour = &quot;black&quot;, shape = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png" width="1536" /></p>
<p>The principal components seem to reflect the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC1 seems to indicate the <em>intensity of the taste</em>: i.e. a smoky, medicinal taste (e.g. Laphroaig or Lagavulin) vs a smoother experience (e.g. Auchentoshan or Abelour)</li>
<li>PC2 seems to indicate the <em>complexity of the taste</em>: i.e. an extremely balanced taste profile (e.g. Glenfiddich or Auchentoshan) vs a more characteristic taste profile (e.g. Glendronach or Macallan)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us verify whether the clusters indeed overrepresent certain regions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tabs &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, 3)
for (i in seq(3)) {
    idx &lt;- which(cl$clustering == i)
    regions &lt;- df$Region[idx]
    tabs[[i]] &lt;- table(regions)
}
cluster.df &lt;- data.frame(&quot;Cluster&quot; = 1:3, do.call(rbind, tabs))
print(cluster.df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Cluster Campbeltown Highlands Islands Islay Lowlands Speyside
## 1       1           2        17       2     2        0       19
## 2       2           0         8       2     1        3       22
## 3       3           0         2       2     4        0        0</code></pre>
<p>Indeed, certain regions are overrepresented in the three clusters. In summary, the interpretation of the clusters is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster 1:</strong> <em>Complex whiskeys</em>, mostly from the Highlands/Speyside</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 2:</strong> <em>Well-balanced whiskeys</em>, mostly from Speyside and Highlands</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 3:</strong> <em>Smoky whiskeys</em>, mainly from Islay</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some interesting observations to make from the visualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oban and Clynelish are the only Highlands distilleries that produce tastes resembling those from distilleries on Islay.</li>
<li>Highland and Speyside whiskeys differ mainly in one dimension. At one extreme are smooth, well-balaned whiskeys such as Glenfiddich. At the other extreme, are whiskeys with a more characteristic tase profile such as Macallan.</li>
</ul>

<div id="kernel-pca" class="section level2">
<h2>Kernel PCA</h2>
<p>KPCA is an extension of PCA that makes use of kernel functions, which are the most prominent characteristc of support vector machines. By mapping the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, it is possible to separate data even if they are not linearly separable.</p>
<p>In KPCA, observations are transformed to a kernel matrix via</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K = k(x,y) = \phi(x)^T \phi(y)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k(x,y)\)</span> is the kernel function for observations <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the corresponding function that maps the observations into reproducing kernel Hilbert space and does not need to be explicitly computed due to the <em>kernel trick</em>. According to the kernel trick, we just need to compute the kernel function.</p>
<div id="using-kpca-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Using KPCA in R</h3>
<p>The <code>kpca</code> is made available through the <code>kernlab</code> package. By default, the radial basis function kernel is used for matrix input. It is defined by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K (x, y) = \exp \left(- \frac{-||x − t||^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the inverse kernel width.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(kernlab) # for kpca function
# use the default of sigma = 0.1 because it works well
pca.k &lt;- kpca(as.matrix(data), kpar = list(sigma = 0.1))
plot(pca.k@eig) # eigenvalues</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># select 20 dimensions for prediction according to eigenvalues
n.dim.model &lt;- 20
pc &lt;- pca.k@pcv</code></pre>
<p>Let us plot the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggrepel) # for geom_text_repel
kpca.df &lt;- data.frame(&quot;Label&quot; = df$Distillery, &quot;Region&quot; = df$Region,
                      &quot;PC1&quot; = pc[,1], &quot;PC2&quot; = pc[,2])
ggplot(kpca.df, aes(label = Label, x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Region)) + 
    geom_text_repel()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>In terms of the visualization, the results are similar to what we obtained with conventional PCA. The whiskeys from Islay are well-separated and we can see a cluster of Speyside whiskeys, while the Highlands whiskeys are rather spread throughout.</p>
<p>A disdavantage of KPCA is that you need to deal with the hyperparameters of the kernel functions, which should be tuned in accordance with the data. Moreover, KPCA is not as interpretable as PCA because it is not possible to determine how much variance is explained by individual dimensions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="t-sne" class="section level2">
<h2>t-SNE</h2>
<p>t-SNE can be performed in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Rtsne)
set.seed(1234) # reproducibility
tsne &lt;- Rtsne(data, dims = 2, perplexity = 5)
t.df &lt;- as.data.frame(tsne$Y)
colnames(t.df) &lt;- c(&quot;V1&quot;, &quot;V2&quot;)
t.df &lt;- cbind(t.df, Cluster = factor(cl$clustering))
t.df$Distillery &lt;- rownames(t.df)
ggplot(t.df, aes(x = V1, y = V2, color = Cluster, label = Distillery)) +
    geom_point() + geom_text()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The result is a bit more clearer with t-SNE than with PCA and the two dimensions have slightly different interpretations than with PCA:</p>
<ul>
<li>V1 seems to indicate how balanced/intense the taste is. The outliers here are the smoky Islay whiskeys on the left (e.g. Lagavulin) as well as some of the richer Highland whiskeys on the right (e.g. Macallan). The whiskeys in the middle such as Glenfiddich have a very balanced taste profile.</li>
<li>V2: I cannot figure that out.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="using-pca-for-machine-learning" class="section level2">
<h2>Using PCA for machine learning</h2>
<p>When validating a machine learning that is fitted to data that has been transformed using PCA, it is crucial that PCA is done independently for the training and test data sets. Why? If PCA were performed on the whole data set, the orthogonal projection obtained via PCA would be influenced by the test data. Thus, when testing the performance of the model on the test data, the performance of the model would be overestimated since the projection is tuned to the space in which the test samples reside. Thus, the following approach needs to be followed:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Perform PCA on the test data set and train the model on the transformed data.</li>
<li>Apply the learned PCA transformation from the training data on the test data set and evaluate the performance of the model on the transformed data.</li>
</ol>
<p>To exemplify the workflow, let us predict the region that a whiskey originates from given its taste profile. For this purpose, we will use the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbor model because we the few features we have (p = 12) will be further reduced by PCA. Moreover, the feature space is small because all variables are in <span class="math inline">\([0,4]\)</span>. Since we have to optimize the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, we also set aside a validation set for determining this parameter.</p>
<div id="obtaining-the-pca-transformation" class="section level3">
<h3>Obtaining the PCA transformation</h3>
<p>First, we write some funtions for validating the performance of the prediction. We will simply use the accuracy here, although another performance measure may be more appropriate because it is likely that the regions for which few samples are available are confused more often. Moreover, we assign 50% of the observations to the training set, 25% for the validation set (for tuning <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), and 25% for testing the performance of the selected model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># split data into 3 parts: training, validation, and testing

<p>Having prepared the evaluation functions and the data, we can transform the data using PCA. Note that the PCA is only run on the training data and not on the other data sets. Rather, we use the <code>predict.princomp</code> function to apply the rotation matrix obtained from the training data onto the other data sets. Note that the name of this function is misleading because it does not really predict anything.</p>

<p>Now that we have transformed the training, validation, and test sets into PCA space, we can use <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbors. Note that this prediction scenario is challenging because some regions such as Islands and Lowlands are underrepresented. If we would select <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with a very large value (e.g. 30), then most samples would be assigned to the overrepresented regions. Since we are using accuracy as a performance measure, such a classifier would unfortunately actually perform well. Thus, we conservatively limit the range of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in order to prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>So, using <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbors, PCA does indeem seem to boost the prediction accuracy for this data set although there are few features to begin with. However, there are some low-variance features in the data set (e.g. <code>Tobacco</code> or <code>Malty</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># variances of whiskeys characteristics
print(diag(var(data)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      Body Sweetness     Smoky Medicinal   Tobacco     Honey     Spicy 
## 0.8656635 0.5145007 0.7458276 0.9801642 0.1039672 0.7279070 0.6157319

<p>Now that we are able to identify the six regions of Scottish whiskey with a respectable accuracy only by their taste, the question is if we can still obtain a better performane. We know that it is hard to predict the Scotch regions that are underrepresented in the data set. So, what would happen if we limit ourselves to fewer regions? The PCA analysis suggest that we could regroup the labels in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Island whiskeys are grouped with Islay whiskeys</li>
<li>Lowland/Campbeltown whiskeys are grouped with Highland whiskeys</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the problem is reduced to three regions: Island/Islay whiskeys, Highland/Lowland/Campbeltown whiskeys, and Speyside whiskeys. Let us run the analysis again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># regroup labels
labels &lt;- df$Region
labels[which(labels == &quot;Islands&quot;)] &lt;- &quot;Islay&quot;
labels[which(labels == &quot;Lowlands&quot;)] &lt;- &quot;Highlands&quot;
labels[which(labels == &quot;Campbeltown&quot;)] &lt;- &quot;Highlands&quot;
# rename groups
labels &lt;- factor(labels)
levels(labels) &lt;- c(&quot;Highlands/Lowlands/Campbeltown&quot;, &quot;Islay/Islands&quot;, &quot;Speyside&quot;)
# increase range for k: we have more samples per region now
k.sel.pca &lt;- select.k(3:20, df.train.p, df.val.p, labels[samp.train],
                      labels[samp.val])
test.preds.pca &lt;- knn(train = df.train.p, test = df.test.p, 
                      cl = labels[samp.train], k = k.sel.pca)
accuracy.pca.knn &lt;- get.accuracy(test.preds.pca, labels[samp.test])
print(paste0(&quot;PCA+KNN accuracy for k = &quot;, k.sel.pca, &quot; is: &quot;, 
             round(accuracy.pca.knn, 3)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;PCA+KNN accuracy for k = 13 is: 0.619&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With an accuracy of 61.9%, we can conclude that, it is indeed worthwhile to group the whiskey regions for which we have fewer samples.</p>

<h3>KPCA for Prediction</h3>
<p>Applying KPCA for prediction is not as straight-forward as applying PCA. In PCA, the eigentvector are computed in the input space but in KPCA, the eigenvectors come from kernel Hilbert space. Thus, it is not simply possible to transform new data points when we do not know the explicit mapping function <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> that is used.</p>
<p>What is easily possible is to create a model from the transformed data. However, this approach is not helpful for doing validation because this would mean that we include the test set in the PCA. So, the approach in the following approach <strong>should not be used for validating a model</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Z &lt;- pca.k@rotated[,1:20] # the transformed input matrix
preds.kpca &lt;- knn(train = Z[samp.train,], test = Z[samp.test,], 
                     cl = df$Region[samp.train], k = k.sel.pca)
# NB: this would overestimate the actual performance
accuracy &lt;- get.accuracy(preds.kpca, df$Region[samp.test])</code></pre>

<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>I find it interesting that the two-dimensional projection of whiskeys has so many large empty areas. This could indicate one of two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is still a lot of potential for experimenting with new, exciting types of whiskeys</li>
<li>There are just so many taste combinations that go well.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am inclined to go with the second option. Why? In the PCA plot, the lower right is the largest region in which no samples reside. Looking at the whiskeys that come close to this region, we find that those are Macallan on the y-axis and Lagavulin on the x-axis. Macallan is known for its complex taste and Lagavulin is known for its smoky taste. So, a whiskey that comes to lie on the lower right of the 2-dimensional PCA space would have both properties: a complex taste plus a very smoky taste. I would assume that both tastes would be just too much for the palate to handle (i.e. smokiness masks complexity). Thus, this unexplored region of taste can be considered to be <em>the whiskey twilight zone</em>, as exemplified by this plot:</p>
