Dimensionality reduction has two primary use cases: data exploration and machine learning. It is useful for data exploration because dimensionality reduction to few dimensions (e.g. 2 or 3 dimensions) allows for visualizing the samples. Such a visualization can then be used to obtain insights from the data (e.g. detect clusters and identify outliers). For machine learning, dimensionality reduction is relevant when there are many features, particularly when there are more features than samples. By reducing the size of the feature space, it is possible to obtain models that generalize better since the signal-to-noise ratio is improved.
