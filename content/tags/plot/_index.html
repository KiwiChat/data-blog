<p>There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data. Of those, however, only a few are frequently used. The most important plots are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/histogram/">histogram</a> consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements and is ideal for showing the distribution of a variable.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/scatterplot/">scatter plot</a> shows the value of two variables as points and is ideal for identifying correlated variables.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/barplot/">bar plot</a> shows the extent of values according to the height of bars. If the data are normally distributed, they can be display variation by including error bars.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/boxplot/">box plot</a> indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements in terms of the first, second, and third quartile.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/">Q-Q plot</a> can be used to compare whether two samples have similar distributions.</li>
</ul>
