<p>There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data. Of those, however, only a few are frequently used. The most important plots are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/histogram/">histogram</a> consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements</li>
<li>The scatter plot shows the value of individual measurements as points</li>
<li>The bar plot shows measurements as bars</li>
<li>The box plot indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements (e.g.Â the median)</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/">Q-Q plot</a>: compare whether two samples have similar distributions</li>
</ul>
