There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data. 

## Basic plots

The following plots are frequently used:

* The [bar plot](/post/data-visualization/barplot/) shows the extent of values according to the height of bars. If the data are normally distributed, they can be display variation by including error bars.
* The [box plot](/post/data-visualization/boxplot/) indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements in terms of the first, second, and third quartile.
* The [histogram](/post/data-visualization/histogram/) consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements and is ideal for showing the distribution of a variable.
* The [line plot](/post/data-visualization/line-plot/) connects individual measurements using lines. It is most suited for time-series data.
* The [scatter plot](/post/data-visualization/scatterplot/) shows the value of two variables as points and is ideal for identifying correlated variables.

## Further plots

The following plots are less frequently used than the basic plots. Nevertheless, these plots may be very useful for specific applications.

* The beeswarm plot is an alternative to the box plot that draws individual data points
* The [Q-Q plot](/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/) can be used to compare whether two samples have similar distributions.
* The radar plot shows the values of several properties in a circular layout
* The violin plot is an alternative to the box plot that provides more information on the distribution of the values
