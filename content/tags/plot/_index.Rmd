There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data. Of those, however, only a few are frequently used. The most important plots are the following:

* The [histogram](/post/data-visualization/histogram/) consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements and is ideal for showing the distribution of a variable
* The [scatter plot](/post/data-visualization/scatterplot/) shows the value of two variables as points and is ideal for identifying correlated variables
* The bar plot shows measurements as bars
* The box plot indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements (e.g. the median)
* The [Q-Q plot](/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/): compare whether two samples have similar distributions
