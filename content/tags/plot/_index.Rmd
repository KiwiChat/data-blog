There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data. Of those, however, only a few are frequently used. The most important plots are the following:

* The [histogram](/post/data-visualization/histogram/) consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements and is ideal for showing the distribution of a variable.
* The [scatter plot](/post/data-visualization/scatterplot/) shows the value of two variables as points and is ideal for identifying correlated variables.
* The [bar plot](/post/data-visualization/barplot/) shows the extent of values according to the height of bars. If the data are normally distributed, they can be display variation by including error bars.
* The [box plot](/post/data-visualization/boxplot/) indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements in terms of the first, second, and third quartile.
* The [Q-Q plot](/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/) can be used to compare whether two samples have similar distributions.
